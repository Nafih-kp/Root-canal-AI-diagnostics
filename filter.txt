 C. APPLIED FILTERING METHODS
 In this research, multiple image filtering techniques, i.e.,
 Mean, Median, Contourlet Transform, Bayesian, Non-local,
 and Gaussian, are applied to improve the employed dataset.
 Each subsection explains a specific filtering method and its
 mathematical basis.
 1) MEAN
 The mean filter is a familiar image processing method
 used in object detection to reduce noise and smooth
 images. It replaces each pixel’s value with the average of
 its neighboring pixels within a specified kernel window.
 Mathematically, for a kernel of size m × n, the mean filter
 computes the average intensity at pixel location (x,y) as:
 M(x,y) = 1
 mn 
k
 i=−k
 k
 j=−k
 I(x +i,y +j)
 (1)
 where I(x + i,y + j) represents the intensity of the pixel at
 coordinates (x + i,y + j) in the image.
 2) MEDIAN
 The median filter is a widely used technique in object
 detection for noise reduction and preserving edge details.
 It replaces each pixel’s value with the median value of
 its neighboring pixels within a defined kernel window.
 Mathematically, for a kernel of size m × n, the median filter
 computes the median intensity at pixel location (x,y) as:
 M(x,y) = median I(x +i,y+j) | i = −k,...,k,
 j = −k,...,k
 where I(x + i,y + j) denotes the intensity of the pixel at
 coordinates (x + i,y + j) in the image.
 3) CONTOURLET TRANSFORM
 While conventional methods for object detection often rely
 on wavelet transforms, the Contourlet Transform (CT) offers

 distinct advantages due to its superior ability to capture
 curvilinear image structures. DFB filters utilize directional
 f
 ilters like Gabor filters, which can be expressed as:
 h(x,y) = g(x,y) · exp(j2πWx)
 (2)
 where h(x,y) is the directional filter, g(x,y) is a windowing
 function (e.g., Gaussian), and W defines the center frequency
 in the frequency domain.
 4) BAYESIAN
 The Bayesian Wavelet denoising algorithm is a sophisticated
 method for effectively reducing image noise that combines
 wavelet transform with Bayesian statistical principles. Math
ematically, the Bayesian wavelet denoising process adjusts
 wavelet coefficients Wj,k iteratively based on a Bayesian
 model:
 ˆ
 Wj,k = argmax
 Wj,k 
P(Wj,k|data, σ2)
 (3)
 where ˆWj,k represents the denoised wavelet coefficient
 at scale j and position k, P(Wj,k|data,σ2) illustrates the
 posterior probability of Wj,k given the data and noise variance
 σ2.
 5) NON-LOCAL
 The non-local mean (NLM) filter is an advanced image
 processing technique used in object detection to reduce noise
 and enhance fine details. This method computes the intensity
 at each pixel (x,y) as a weighted average of intensities from
 all pixels in the image, where weights are determined by
 the similarity between patches centered at (x,y) and other
 pixels. Mathematically, the non-local mean filter computes
 the filtered intensity N(x,y) at pixel location (x,y) as:
 N(x,y) = 1
 C(x,y) p∈
 I(p) · w(p,x,y)
 (4)
 where I(p) denotes the intensity of the pixel at position p in
 the image, istheentire image domain, w(p,x,y) represents
 the weight based on patch similarity between patches
 centered at (p) and (x,y), and C(x,y) is the normalization
 factor ensuring the sum of weights equals one.
 6) GAUSSIAN
 Gaussian filtering is a fundamental preprocessing technique
 in object detection, employing a kernel defined by a Gaussian
 distribution to convolve with the image. The one-dimensional
 Gaussian function is expressed as:
 G(x) = 1
 √
 2πσ2 
·exp −(x −µ)2
 2σ2
 (5)
 This filter reduces noise and preserves critical features
 by weighting pixel intensities based on their proximity to
 the kernel center. In two dimensions Gaussian function is
 expressed as:
 G(x,y) = 1
 2πσ2 ·exp −(x −µ)2 +(y−µ)2
 2σ2
 66562
 (6)
 σ controls the filter’s spread; larger σ values enhance
 smoothing but may blur edges crucial for object detection,
 while smaller σ values retain finer details but offer less noise
 reduction.
